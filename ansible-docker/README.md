# Simple Docker Example - Ansible

To run the example, make sure you have Docker installed on the workstation or VM where this playbook is located, then enter the command:

    $ ansible-playbook main.yml

After a minute or so, Ansible will have built and run a `test` container, built from the included Dockerfile.
